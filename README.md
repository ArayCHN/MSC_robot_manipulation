# Robotic Manipulation with Human Demonstration
This repository stores some of the codes for robotic manipulation.
Most of the core codes can be found under my directory /WANGRUI

However, as it is impossible to construct precisely the identical 
hardware platform, our work is unlikely to be reproduced by other labs.

 Later we will publish a repository containing more detailed codes and 
instructions.
