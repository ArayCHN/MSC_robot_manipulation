# Robotic Manipulation with Human Demonstration
This repository stores some of the codes for robotic manipulation.
Most of the core codes can be found under my directory /WANGRUI

However, as it is impossible to construct precisely the identical 
hardware platform, our work is unlikely to be reproduced by other labs. Also, all codes are copyrighted and **NOT** open for spreading for the time being. You can contact us with any questions, though.

 Later we will publish a repository containing more detailed codes and 
instructions, after which reproduction of our results might be possible.
